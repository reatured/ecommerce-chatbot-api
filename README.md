# Shopping Chatbot Frontend

An **AI-powered shopping assistant** that helps users find products through conversation and image search.
---


- **General Conversation** – natural, open-ended chat with a single unified agent  
- **Text-Based Product Recommendation** – e.g., “Recommend me a t-shirt for sports.”  
- **Image-Based Product Search** – upload an image to find visually similar catalog items

## Demo Web Page
👉 [Frontend Demo](https://shop-glass-ai.lovable.app/)  
Try Car and Backpack for now as they have the most data in the database for demo.

👉 [Backend Repo](https://github.com/reatured/ecommerce-chatbot-api)  
👉 [Product Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjQn5xgkAsXlW0kxCfq60C8P_siXzzGksx8LdMOH9YU/edit?usp=sharing)  
_Add more products in any category, and the chatbot automatically adapts its recommendations in real time._

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Design Decisions

### 🧠 Frontend — React + TypeScript
- Parse structured AI responses and dynamically update UI stages based on parsed metadata  
- Product display panel that renders products from AI response metadata  
- Dynamic data retrieval from the backend database  

### ⚡ Backend — FastAPI (Python)
- **Anthropic AI API** for conversational chatbot and image understanding  
- Tool-use enabled, allowing AI to dynamically read needed categories and options for further conversation  
- Endpoints such as *get all categories* and *get all options* allow AI to quickly fetch necessary info without loading the full database — reducing token cost, data transfer, and latency  
- **Google Sheets (CSV)** as a lightweight, updatable product database  
- Product information updates in real time; since AI reads data dynamically, any database change is immediately reflected  
- Built-in caching and filtering for efficient product queries  

**Why this stack?**  
The **React + FastAPI** setup provides clear separation of concerns — React manages user interaction and state, while FastAPI handles data, logic, and AI requests.  
Both are lightweight, modern, and fast, enabling seamless real-time communication between frontend and backend.
